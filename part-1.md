## Introduce yourself to Git

1. **Configuring Name and Email:** 
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "<YOUR FULL NAME>"
   git config --global user.email "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>"
   ```

2. **Check Configuration:**
   ```bash
   git config --global --list
   ```

## Establish the Git-GitHub connection - Clone

3. **Create a repo on GitHub** 
   - Create a private repo with README on GitHub and stay logged in.

4. **Copy the HTTPS link**

   - Click on “code” and copy the “https” link.

5. **Clone the repo** 

   - Change into a directory where you want to clone the repo and clone:
   ```bash
   cd <selected directory>
   git clone <https of repo on github from step 4>
   ```

6. **Figure Out if authentication is needed:**
   - **Authentication exits**
     - If authentication is previously done, the cloning takes place successfully, jump to step [9](#commitpushpull)
   - **Authentication does not exist**
     - If the cloning did not take place and you get authentication error follow along. 
   - **For Linux and Mac:**
     - If prompted, do not enter your username and password directly; you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT).

   - **For Windows:**
     - Follow the browser login prompt to authenticate your GitHub credentials for Git. If it fails, proceed with creating a PAT.

7. **Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:

   - On GitHub, navigate to `GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Token > Generate New Token`. Select:
     - `Repo`
     - `Workflow`
     - `User`

   - Generate a new PAT, copy, and paste it somewhere safe. You will not be able to see this after you refresh the page. 

8. **Use the PAT for Git authentication:**

   - When prompted asking for GitHub username, enter your GitHub username.

   - When prompted for GitHub password, paste the PAT instead of your GitHub password.

   - In this stage the repo should be cloned successfully

   - After this step Git should remember the GitHib credentials until the PAT is expired. Otherwise read more on https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git?platform=linux


## Commit / Push / Pull

9. **Verify the clone** 

   - After successful authentication, your repo should be cloned. 
   - Change into the repo directory and inspect the cloned files:
    ```bash
    cd <repo-name>
    ls
    ```

10. **Check the connection status:**
    ```bash
    git remote show origin
    ```

11. **Modify README and push back to GitHub:**

    - Edit README file and add: “Input from local repo to be pushed to remote repo.”
    - Use the following commands to commit and push the changes to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git status 
    git add README.md
    git status 
    git commit -m "Testing connection"
    git status 
    git push origin main 
    git status
    ```

12. **Refresh GitHub to confirm changes.**

13. **Edit on GitHub and pull changes:**

    - On GitHub, edit README to add: "Input from remote repo to be pulled to local repo."
    - Commit message: “Connecting from GitHub.”
    - Pull the changes on the command line:
    ```bash
    git status 
    git fetch origin main
    git status 
    git pull origin main
    ```

14. **Check Commit Logs:**
    ```bash
    git log 
    git log --oneline
    ```

## Use RStudio / VS Code / any other IDE

15. **Start fresh in the IDE**

    - Delete the local repo cloned in Step 5.

16. **Clone using the IDE**

    - In RStudio: Go to `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`, paste the repo URL, choose a directory and create the project.
    - In VS Code: open a folder, then `ctrl+shift+p >Clone > Clone from GitHub`, paste the repo URL and hit enter 
    - Verify the clone

17. **Edit in IDE and push changes:**

    - Using IDE edit README to add: “Input from local repo to be pushed to remote repo using RStudio/VS code.”
    - Commit message: “Commit from IDE.”
    - Add, commit, and push changes using the IDE.

18. **Edit on GitHub and pull changes using IDE:**

    - On GitHub, edit README to add: "Input from remote repo to be pulled to local repo using IDE."
    - Commit message: “Editing from GitHub.”
    - Fetch and pull the latest changes from GitHub using RStudio 

19. **Review commit history in IDE:**
    - In RSTudio: use git history 
    - In VS Code: use git graph 

## Going back to history

20. **Commit to be amended** 

    - Add another line to README file: “Input from local repo to be amended, the content is the same, only commit message is amended.”
    - Commit with:
    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "to be amended"
    ```
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```


21. **Amend a Commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit --amend "It is amended now"
    ```
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```

    ❓ Has the commit message been amended? 


22. **Commit to be uncommitted** 

    - Add another line to README file: “Input from local repo to be committed and uncommitted, the content is the same, only the commit is reversed.”
    - Commit with:
    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "to be uncommitted"
    ```
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```

23. **Un-commit a Commit:**
    ```bash
    git reset HEAD~1
    ```
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    ❓ Has the last commit disappeared? 

    ❓ Check the content of the README file, has the content changed as a result of last operation?  

24. **Commit to be reversed:**
    - Look at the Git status    
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    ❓ You see uncommitted changes, can you verify what changes are to be committed? 

    - commit: 
    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "to be reversed both the commit and content"
    ```
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```

25. **Reverse a commit:**
    ```bash
    git reset --hard HEAD~1
    ```
     - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    ❓ Has the last commit disappeared? 


    ❓ Check the content of the README file, can you explain what happened to the latest changes you committed in step 23? 

26. **Commit to be reverted:**
    
    - Add another line to the README file: “Input from local repo to be reverted. The content will be gone but the commit stays in the history”
    - Commit with:
    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "to be reverted"
    ```
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```

27. **Revert a Commit:**
    - Copy the commit hash of the commit you want to revert from previous step
    - Revert by running this and pasting the commit hash: 
    ```bash
        git revert <commit hash>
    ```
    - This will be a new commit, save and close the commit prompt to complete the revert.

28. **Verify the revert** 
    - Look at the commit log 
     ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    
    ❓ Has the last commit disappeared? 


    ❓ Check the content of the README file, can you explain what happened to the latest changes you committed in step 25? 
  
29. **Reflect**

    ❓ Can you imagine different scenarios where "amend", "un-commit", "reverse" or "revert" cab be used?
